### 1.1 Compare and contrast OSI and TCP/IP models
-----
Both models are frameworks to help understand network concepts and technologies. The OSI model is 7 layers and TCP/IP model is 4 layers.

#### OSI Layers: (ALL, PEOPLE, SEEM, TO, NEED, DATA, PROCESSING)
1. Physical, 2. Data Link, 3. Network, 4. Transport, 5. Session, 6. Presentation, 7. Application

#### TCP/IP Model Layers:
1. Link, 2. Internet, 3. Transport, 4. Application

#### Comparison of the two models:
| OSI Model | Protocols and Services | PDU | TCP/IP Model |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| 7. Application  | HTTP, FTP | Data | Application |
| 6. Presentation  | Telnet, NTP  | Data | Application |
| 5. Session | DHCP, PING | Data | Application |
| 4. Transport | TCP, UDP | Segment | Transport |
| 3. Network | IP, ARP, ICMP, IGMP | Packet | Network |
| 2. Data Link | Ethernet, Wireless | Frame | Network Interface |
| 1. Physical | Framerelay, ATM | Bits | Network Interface |

#### Layer Descriptions:
1. Physical Layer – Defines how to move bits from one device to another. It details how cables, connectors and network interface cards are going to work and how to send and receive bits.
 
2. Data Link Layer – Encapsulates a packet in a frame. A frame contains a header and a trailer that enable devices to communicate. A header contains a source and a destination MAC address. A trailer contains the Frame Check Sequence field, which is used to detect transmission errors.

The data link layer has two sublayers:
* Logical Link Control – used for flow control and error detection
* Media Access Control – used for hardware addressing and controlling the access method
 
3. Network Layer – Defines device addressing, routing, and path determination. Device (logical) addressing is used to identify a host on a network (e.g. by its IP address).
 
4. Transport Layer – Segments great chunks of data received from the upper layer protocols. Establishes and terminates connections between two computers. Used for flow control and data recovery.
 
5. Session Layer – Defines how to establish and terminate a session between the two systems.
 
6. Presentation Layer – Defines data formats. Compression and encryption are defined at this layer.
 
7. Application Layer – This layer is the closest to the user. It enables network applications to communicate with other network applications.


### 1.2 Compare and contrast TCP and UDP protocols
-----
#### TCP = Transmission Control Protocol
* Connection oriented - Supports windowing and has inbuilt error detection and recovery.
* Provides reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery of data.
* Used for File Transfer, Email, WWW and HTTP GET requests.
* TCP handles all handshaking (3-way handshake) - SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK

**Features of TCP:**
* Multiplexing using ports
* Error recovery – Process of numbering and acknowledging data with Sequence and Acknowledgment header fields
* Flow control using windowing – Process that uses windows sizes to protect buffer space and routing devices from being overloaded with traffic
* Connection establishment and termination – Process used to initialize port numbers and Sequence and Acknowledgment fields
* Ordered data transfer and data segmentation – Continuous streams of bytes from an upper layer process that is “segmented” for transmission and delivered to upper-layer processes at the receiving device with the bytes in the same order.

#### UDP = User Datagram Protocol
* Simple connectionless oritented - Doesn't do a handshake, just tries to send data as fast as possible.
* Emphasizes reduced latency over reliability
* Used by time-sensitive applications that do not require reliable data stream service

**Features of UDP:**
* Multiplexing using ports: this allows the OS to allow many services to use the same IP address by using port numbering.


### 1.3 Describe the impact of infrastructure components in an enterprise network
-----
**1.3.a Firewalls** - Designed to prevent unauthorized access to your network.
* Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) - Security devices combining firewall, AV, IPS and VPN. Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) - IPS, IDS, Deep Packet Inspection.

**1.3.b Access points** - Allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network. The access point is connected to the network via a wired connection and allows wireless devices to connect to it via probing & authentication.

**1.3.c Wireless controllers** - Used by network administrators to manage and deploy configuration for multiple access points, reducing management overhead. AP's that get configuration from a Wireless controllers are called light access points.


### 1.4 Describe the effects of cloud resources on enterprise network architecture
-----
**1.4.a Traffic path to internal and external cloud services**
* Private WAN
* VPN tunnel over the internet

**1.4.b Virtual services**
* Software as a Service (SaaS): The Cloud provider is responsible for access to services, such as email, communication, and Office 365 that are delivered over the Internet. The user is only needs to provide their data.
* Platform as a Service (PaaS): The Cloud provider is responsible for access to the development tools and services used to deliver the applications.
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The Cloud provider is responsible for access to the network equipment, virtualized network services, and supporting network infrastructure.

**1.4.c Basic virtual network infrastructure**
Hypervisors are installed directly onto the hardware, usualy on enterprise servers and data center networking devices.

Cloud services run inside Virtual Machines. Virtual Machines emulate all aspects including a machines network connections, creating Virtual Network Interfaces.

Virtual network infrastructure is required to connect the virtual machines or “instances” inside the VM similar to a real network. This involves the use of Virtual Switches, Routers and Firewalls often called “cloud firewalls/routers/switches”.

### 1.5 Compare and contrast collapsed core and three-tier architectures
-----
#### Collapsed Core model:
* Core and Distribution layers are combined as a single layer (Implemented as the same device)
* There are only two layers (Collapsed Core and Access Layer)
* The collapsed core devices must be capable of core functions: high speed network connectivity and distribution functions: routing, filtering, NAT, etc.
* Reduces cost whilst maintaining majority of three tier benefits.
* Suited for small enterprises and single building environments.
* Not as flexible or scalable.

![Collapsed Core Topology Example](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/ccna-data-center/9780133860429/graphics/01fig03.jpg)

#### Three-tier model:
* Is a hierarchical mode, has 3 layers (Core, Distribution and Access Layer)
* Core - move large amounts of traffic as fast as possible, majority of users.
* Distribution - Routing, Filtering, WAN Access, NAT, Firewalls, redistribution.
* Access - Device connectivity.
* Reliable, scalable, cost-effective hierarchial inter-network.
* Each layer provides specific functions.

![Three-tier model Topology Example](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/i/200001-300000/220001-230000/223001-224000/223677.eps/_jcr_content/renditions/223677.jpg)

**Core Layer:**
* Fast backbone transport, pass traffic as fast as possible, low latency and high speed (fast transport).
* Reliable, scalable and fault tolerant.
* Design principles: Never slow down traffic, no work group access, upgrade existing instead of expanding.
* Design goals: High reliability (speed and redundancy), Speed (low latency), Low convergence times (routing protocols)

**Distribution Layer:**
* Policy based connectivity. Controls boundary between access and core layers.
* Routing (RIPv2, OSPF, EIGRP), Policies (ACLs, NAT), Security (Firewalls).
* Aggregation of LAN Links.
* Broadcast domain control (L3), redundancy and load balancing.

**Access Layer:**
* Workgroup/user access to the network, port security, network segmentation, collision domain split up.
* Layer 2 switching, STP.


### 1.6 Compare and contrast network topologies
-----
**1.6.a Star:**
  * Each network host is connected to a central hub with a point-to-point connection.
  * All traffic on the network passes through the central hub.
  * The hub acts as a signal booster or repeater.
  * Easiest topology to design and implement, simplicity, needs a lot of cabling.
  * Low redundancy, if the hub goes down, entire network goes down.
  
![Star Topology](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/star.gif)

**1.6.b Mesh:**
  * Every node/device is connected to each other, requiring a lot of cabling.
  * Too costly and complex for practical networks, normally used for small network.
  
![Mesh Topology](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/mesh.gif)
 
**1.6.c Hybrid:**
  * Uses a combination of any two or more topologies in such a way that the resulting network does not exhibit one of the standard topologies.
  * Common examples: Star ring network and bus network.
  

### 1.7 Select the appropriate cabling type based on implementation requirements
-----
**Crossover cable:**
* Use when connecting like devices together
* Switch to Switch (autodetect on most switches will work with straight-through cables, but crossover is the correct choice)
* Router to Router
* Router to PC
* 10Base-T and 100Base-T UTP (1 to 2 and 3 to 6)
* For a crossover, use 568A on one end and 568B on the other end

**Straight-through cable:**
* Use when connecting unlike devices together.
* Also known as a patch cable.
* Switch to PC.
* Router to Switch.
* For a crossover, use 568B on both ends.

**Rollover cable:**
* Literally roll the cable over to make the other end.
* Can be used to connect a host EIA-TIA 232 interface to a router console serial COM port.

**Fiber:**
* Very long distances, but seeing it more on the LAN now as well.
* Made up of Core, Cladding and Buffer.  Cladding is industry standard at 125m.
* As a point of reference, a human hair is 50 microns.
* Single mode fiber: tighter cladding = smaller core, one mode of light propagates. Used for long distance DWDM networks.
* Multi-mode fiber: looser, larger core allows multiple light particles, less distance. Used for LAN's, short distances.

**1000Base-T UTP:**
* Uses all four cable pairs for simultaneous transmission in both directions.
* No dedicated transmit and recieve paris, and consequently, crossover cables are never required.
* The physical medium attachment sublayer (PMA) provides identification of each pair and usually continues to work even over cable where the pairs are unusually swapped or crossed.


### 1.8 Apply troubleshooting methodologies to resolve problems
-----
**1.8.a Perform and document fault isolation**
1. Identify the Problem.
2. Establish a Theory of Probable Causes.
3. Test the Theory to Determine Cause.
4. Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem and Implement the Solution.
5. Verify Full System Functionality and Implement Preventitive Measures.
6. Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes.

**1.8.b Resolve or escalate**
* Resolve a problem if you have the experience and knowledge to resolve a problem immediately, otherwise;
* Problem should be escalated when it requires a managers decision, some specific expertise, or network access level unavailable to the troubleshooting technician.

**1.8.c Verify and monitor resolution**
* Ping devices - Test for successful connectivity.
* Traceroute devices - Trace a path to the destination.
* Show ip interface brief - Verify that interfaces are OK and have the correct status: UP and UP mean the interface can send and receive traffic.
